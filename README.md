# College Network Simulation Project
This is a simulation project of a college network, designed to demonstrate the functionality of a basic computer network. The simulation involves creating a virtual network infrastructure with multiple interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, routers, switches, and other networking components. The aim of this project is to provide a hands-on experience of how computer networks work in real-life scenarios.

## Project Description
The simulation project will be developed using the Cisco Packet Tracer, a network simulation software. The virtual network infrastructure will be designed to simulate a small college network with multiple departments, classrooms, and administrative offices. The simulation will include setting up the following components:

Core router
Distribution router
Access switches
Servers (e.g., file server, web server, email server)
End devices (e.g., laptops, desktops)
The simulation will involve setting up IP addresses, VLANs, and routing protocols, such as OSPF or EIGRP. The simulation will also include creating network security policies, such as access control lists (ACLs) and firewalls.

## Installation
To run this simulation project, you will need to install the Cisco Packet Tracer software on your computer. You can download the software from the official Cisco website. Please ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements before installing the software.

## Usage
To use the simulation project, you can import the simulation file into the Cisco Packet Tracer software. The simulation file will contain all the necessary configurations for the virtual network infrastructure. You can then explore the network topology, configure network devices, and test network connectivity.

The simulation project can be used for educational purposes, such as learning the basics of computer networking, or for testing network designs and configurations.
